# Pathfinding Project

This a learning project based on Cl√©ment Mihailescu (creator of AlgoExpert) take on pathfinding algorithms.

## Motivation

Got asked a similar question in a interview recently and with 15m left on the interview, I couldn't even begin to tackle it since my knowledge on these kind of algorithms is close to null. As well, I always found fascinating how Starcraft 2, for example, manages to handle pathfinding during the course of the game and always wanted to learn how it works!

## Goals

    -Get stuck
    -Figure out a way to un-stuck lol
    -Gain knowledge on handling pathfinding algorithms
    -Tackle new problems that I haven't encountered before
    -Have a project in which I can reference later on in my career.
